I saw this comment on Reddit a couple days ago, and it hit me like a ton of bricks:

> I found the version of react-router-dom used in the course, but when I made a roll back the project was still not working so I felt really tired and just started another course :(  

üß±üß±üß±

Oh friend, I have been there. I remember those days clearly. 

You start some new course or tutorial, and there is this feeling of excitement. It‚Äôs palpable! Everything is *fresh* and you‚Äôre gonna build and learn and life is *good*.

Things usually start well enough. A few lessons in and you‚Äôre tracking and things are working. But inevitably, there comes the crash. The difficulty ramps WAY up, your code breaks, and you can‚Äôt for the life of you figure out why. You guess and check a hundred different things. There are chunks of code commented out *everywhere*. You try to rollback to when things were working‚Ä¶ still no dice. 

We‚Äôve all been there. Many times. 

So here is my list of what to remember and what to do when you get stuck like this in your web development journey.

1. Recognize the pain is valuable
2. Be as systematic as possible
3. Take a break
4. Ask for help	
5. Know when to persevere and when to move on


## 1. Recognize the pain is valuable
This is, by far, the most crucial thing I want to convey. This experience you are having- of wresting with code, feeling frustrated, trying to figure out what went wrong and how to fix it‚Ä¶ this experience is *solid gold* to you. It‚Äôs incredibly valuable. It‚Äôs just as valuable (if not more so) than the actual course material. 

If you‚Äôve been exposed at all to the world of programmer humor and coding memes (yes, that is a world) you quickly pick up on the fact that life as a developer is split between 
	1. the soul-crushing frustration of wresting with nonworking code and 
	2. with the overwhelming elation of when you finally figure it out.

It‚Äôs just part of the game! Yes, you do eventually get better, and working through problems and issues gets easier and more intuitive. But at the core developers get paid to solve problems. 

So the goal is not to avoid situations like this, but instead to learn and grow and get more skilled at handling situations like this.

So while this doesn‚Äôt necessarily help solve the technical issue you‚Äôre stuck on right now‚Ä¶ remember: this is part of being a developer. Take a deep break. No pain, no gain.

## 2. Be as systematic as possible
Here we start to get into a little bit more tactical help for the issue. The goal here is to move from a semi-random guess-and-check approach to a clear-headed systematic strategy of troubleshooting.

At first, you may be tempted to debug in a ‚Äúthrowing spaghetti at the wall‚Äù type of approach. This looks like a ton of random Google searches, dozens of console.logs and commented out chunks of code. And sometimes this works.  But if it doesn‚Äôt, you‚Äôre not left in a very great spot.

Instead, take a moment to think and plan. Write down a list of the top few things you *think* may be the issue. Then start working through your list, one at a time. For each item, figure out how to eliminate it as the cause of the issue *with as near 100% certainty as possible*. Then move on to the next item. As you think of more potential culprits, add them to your list.

This approach helps calm your brain and restore a sense of control to the process. Rather than feeling more lost and frustrated with each failed guess-and-check, now you‚Äôre making consistent progress and getting closer with every step.

## 3. Take a break
Simple, but effective. If you‚Äôve been struggling with the issue for awhile, take a break. Go for a walk, grab lunch, exercise and shower, follow a 20 minute yoga video on YouTube. 

I‚Äôm a huge believer in the unconscious brain‚Äôs ability to continue processing the issue as we step away. Most developers have a story or two of a code solution coming to them in the shower or in a dream.

## 4. Ask for help
Even with a clear-headed and systematic approach, and with well-timed breaks, there will be times when you can‚Äôt figure the issue out. It‚Äôs time to reach out for help if you haven‚Äôt done so yet.

Depending on the issue and your personal network, this might be a dev friend you can screenshare with, or an online forum or site where you can post your question and code snippet. Be logical about where to ask, and be considerate  of the person you‚Äôre asking (be well prepared, share what you‚Äôve done so far, and be respectful and appreciative of their time). 

Don‚Äôt be too shy! Be willing to put yourself out there.

## 5. Know when to persevere and when to move on

By this point, hopefully you‚Äôve got the issue solved and have moved on. But maybe not. Maybe this issue is crushing you, despite everything you‚Äôve thrown at it.

While you need to have a tendency toward perseverance (remember item #1 above), there are times to move on. 

I remember listening to a podcast with a programmer who talked about how his #1 suggestion to new developers is to work on whatever keeps you coming back to write code the next day. The main point is not whatever exact thing you‚Äôre working on at this moment. What matters more is that you keep coming back.

So embrace the struggle, but also embrace the freedom you have to start over with something new. There is no wrong answer here, as long as you keep showing up.
