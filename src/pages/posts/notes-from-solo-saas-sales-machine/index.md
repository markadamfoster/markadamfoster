I've been needing some motivation and ideas for getting a side project off the ground, and ran across a video from [Steli Efti](https://twitter.com/Steli) at MicroConf a couple years ago.

If you do sales of any kind, it's definitely worth an hour of your time. Go watch it [here](https://vimeo.com/131441010).

I'm going to publish the rough notes I took while watching it, and at the end I'll give my one biggest takeaway.

## Notes

### To be dangerous in sales, understand these:

* sell based on value (not features, etc)
* qualify people (ask questions until you actually know if you can help them or not)
* follow up until you get a yes or no

### Content sells

* How people will discover you, return to you, trust you.
* It compounds over time (unlike ads, etc)

### Sales Emails

#### Email is a three step process:

1.  Open - figure out how to get them to open the email

    * you're a human, act like one!
    * be personable, not overly professional
    * don't be gimmicky or tricky (fake questions, etc)

2.  Read - they need to read it

    * either needs to be really short, or really good

3.  Respond - get a response

    * one simple call to action
    * follow up until you get a yes or no

#### If your SaaS product has a trial, you're not emailing them enough.

* Double the number of emails you send them (today)
* Enough emails that some people think they're getting spammed
* Out of 10 people, you're better off with 3 that love you and 7 that hate you, then 10 that are indifferent
* The #1 goal with these emails is to get a response.

#### Cold Emails

* read "Predictable Revenue" by Aaron Ross
* reach out 1-2 levels above your decision maker - very brief - ask for referral down in the org - 10-30% success rate

#### Followups

* "90% of the time when I win, its because I followed up more than anyone else"

* Followup until you get a yes or a no.

* Most people interpret silence to be rejection... that's wrong. Stop trying to read their minds. They're busy, that's it.

* Magic happens when you follow up. Because nobody else is.

* Some people have success with "The breakup email": - "I've been trying to get in touch... I'm going to take you off my list, here's my contact info if you ever want to get in touch."

* Don't reference your previous emails or make them feel guilty for not responding. Keep it short, upbeat, and _just keep following up_.

### Demos

* Should be quick! (10 to 15min)

* Quality first: Can/should they buy, is it worth their time

* Show Benefits, not features: Focus on what's relevant

* Sales vs Training: Demo the value, don't teach functionality

### Referrals

* When you close a deal, ask for referrals. When they say they need to think about it, say "sure... but what's one name in the meantime"?

* When you close a deal, send the person who referred them a thank you note, and have the new customer thank them as well.

* "if you follow up with everyone at least 20 times, magic will happen in your life"

## My Biggest Takeaway

I _loved_ his mindset on following up. When I've sent outreach emails in the past, I've struggled to get to 2 followups before I give up, as I assume they're annoyed and not interested.

My biggest takeaway is "follow up relentlessly until you get a yes or a no, and magic will happen".

I've got a new spreadsheet made for one of my side projects, and it's got 20 columns for tracking when I send followup emails. I'm looking forward to seeing this bear fruit.
