In this lesson we'll learn how to prevent changes to an object in JavaScript using the built in `Object.freeze()` method. Once an object has been passed to `Object.freeze()`, no properties can be added, removed, or changed.

This is helpful in a variety of situations, particularly with preventing inadvertent changes to an object's data throughout a codebase.
