In this lesson we'll learn how to limit the types of changes that can be done to an object in JavaScript using the built in `Object.seal()` method. Once an object has been passed to `Object.seal()`, existing properties can be updated, but no new properties can be added and no properties can be deleted.

This is helpful in a variety of situations, particularly with preventing inadvertent changes to an object's structure throughout a codebase, while still allowing for updates.
