In this lesson, we'll go over two popular ways to create a copy of an object in JavaScript: `Object.assign` and using the spread operator. We'll also go over why using these are important, since JavaScript passes object values by reference. Finally, we'll go over nested objects, and why methods such as Lodash's `cloneDeep` are necessary.
