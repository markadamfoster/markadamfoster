            <p>
              When you grow up in a computer lab, helping your dad fix Apple
              IIGS machines during school holidays, you&apos;re probably
              destined to end up doing something in the tech world.
            </p>

                  caption:
                    'Little Mark with the whole world in front of him...',
                },
              ]}
            />

            <p>
              And while it was a roundabout journey for me (with forays into
              psychology, Spanish, ecology, and bird research), eventually I
              landed back in the world of computers and software development.
            </p>

            <p>
              My start in tech was as a support rep (which is the perfect place
              to begin). I learned how non-techy people use the web and how to
              design products that are beautiful yet simple. After 3 years of
              support, I had gained the superpower of spotting issues that would
              cause support tickets before they were even launched.
            </p>

            <p>
              While answering calls I worked one desk over from our developers.
              I would talk to customers, report bugs and feature requests, and
              watch as they built the product. It didn&apos;t take long to
              realize I wanted to be the one doing the building.
            </p>

            <p>
              I spent the next 3 years of early mornings and late nights
              learning how to code. I built a custom web app for tracking our
              support cases. Then I created custom pricing calculaters and usage
              estimate tools for our sales website. Eventually I started seeking
              out projects from friends, other clients, and building my own
              products.

            <p>
              Fast forward for a few years, and I&apos;ve had the chance to
              build beautiful products for amazing companies. I gradually began
              to specialize in React web development and React Native mobile
              development. I&apos;ve served clients of all sizes, and love
              becoming a trusted resource for my clients.

              I would love for my next project to be for business. Drop me a
              note below, and I&apos;ll get back to you within 24 hours.

              When I&apos;m not behind a screen, you&apos;ll find me spending
              time with my wife and three daughters, mountain biking, and
              skiing.
